## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with
- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Astro + Svelte
- Svelte transitions


### What I learned

For me, the most difficult part of this challenge, was the number card with semi-circle decorations in the middle. Of course, the flip effect is the complement to that decoration. 
I will investigate the solution for this, latter. 

### Continued development

The FLIP animations on the card numbers.
